You are given two sorted arrays arr and arr of lengths m and n respectively, and an 
integer x. Your task is to find the pair of elements (arrf, arr20) such that the absolute
 difference between their sum and x is minimum.
Write a function or program to solve this problem efficiently.
Input:
The input consists of four parts:
The first line contains two integers m and n (1 ≤ m, n≤ 1045), representing the lengths of 
arrays arr and arr2 respectively.
The second line contains m space-separated integers, representing the elements of the 
sorted array arri
The third line contains n space-separated integers, representing the elements of the 
sorted array arr2.
The fourth line contains an integer x (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), denoting the target sum.
Output:
Output two integers i and j, representing the indices of the pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]) 
such that the absolute difference between their sum and x is minimum. If there are 
multiple pairs with the same minimum absolute difference, output the pair with the 
smallest value of i and j.
Example:
Sample Input:
3 4
6 7 9
4 5 6 8
16
Output:
The closest pair is [7, 8]
Sample Input:
4 4
1 4 5 7
10 20 30 40
50
Output:
The closest pair is [7, 40]
In the given example, the arrays arr and arr2 are [6, 7, 9] and [4, 5, 6, 8]
respectively. The target sum x is 16. The pair (arr1[1], arr2[3]) = (7, 8) 
has the sum 7 + 8 = 15, which is closest to x = 16 among all pairs.
Note:
Both arrays arr1 and arr are sorted in ascending order.
The absolute difference between the sum of elements of any pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]) 
and x should be minimized.
