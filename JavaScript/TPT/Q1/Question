Given a sorted array A(sorted in ascending order), having N integers, find if there exists any pair of elements (A[i], Alil) such that their sum is equal to X.
Write a function or program to solve this problem efficiently.
Input:
The input consists of three parts:
The first line contains an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1015), denoting the number of elements in
the array.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the elements of the sorted array A.
The third line contains an integer X (-10^9 ≤ X ≤ 1019), denoting the target sum.
Output:
Output "Yes" and the pair if there exists at least one pair of elements (A[i], A[j]) such
that A[i] + A[j] = X, otherwise output "No".

Sample Input:
6
1 3 57 9 11
10

Output:
Yes
Pair: 19

Example:
Sample Input:
5
14679
18
Output:
No

Explanation:
In the given example, the array A is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] and the target sum X is 10. There
exists a pair of elements (1, 9) such that 1 + 9 = 10, so the output is "Yes".
